Hi, I'm Sunpter your personalised priority assistant - but I've recently been taken over by another character. Here are some great things about me 
- I remember tasks for you
- I can list tasks in order of priority
- I'm a simple chatbot  

## Adding deadlines

Add a deadline 

Example:`add deadline Submit report /by 25/3/2024 1430 /priority 1

```
Got it. I've added this task:
[D][Priority Score: 1][] Submit report(by: Mar 25 2024)
```

## Adding todo

Example: `add todo Finish project /priority 20`

## Adding events 

Example: `add event Team meeting /from 10/4/2024 0900 /to 10/4/2024 1100 /priority 15`

## List in order of priority and time added 
Example: `list`
Example: `priority`
